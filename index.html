        <h2 class="home-headline-1">No greater love for the water</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-1">My first time taking on the Sandy River was the most thrilling of my life.  With just myself, two friends, and a heavily patched rubber raft with smoothed branches for ‘oars’, we three set out to explore places we had never seen that were nevertheless close to home. The joy of discovery, the rush of adrenaline, and the satisfaction of conquest over the white peaks where the river ran roughest is an experience never forgotten.</p>

        <h2 class="home-headline-2">Sharing the experience</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2">This is the kind of experience we wanted everyone to have the chance to feel, and so we three friends created the Rubber Branch Whitewater Rafting Company.  We have been sharing the joys of challenging the river for 8 years and it is time to expand our influence to the world! (And bring in more tourists, that never hurts!)</p>
